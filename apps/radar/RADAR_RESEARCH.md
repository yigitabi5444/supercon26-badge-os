# Radar: what the badge can do (phase 1 research)

Goal: show other badge os badges nearby: who, how far, and if possible which direction.
Hardware facts: ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 (module PCB antenna, 2.4 GHz only), no IMU, no compass (docs/DEVICE_INFO.md).
Optional AS5600 knob on an SAO port. ESP-IDF v6.0.2. "Checked" = read in the local IDF tree; "[n]" = source list at the end.

Outcome: ESP-NOW discovery + FTM + shared ranges (options B and C below, no manual bearing) now run in the OS on every
screen (`badge/ranging.h`); the Radar app only reads `ranging_get`. Where sections 4 and 6 talk about the app owning
the radio or Wi-Fi going off back home, that is the plan of the time, not what the code does.

## 1. Wi-Fi FTM (802.11mc round-trip time)

**Supported on the S3: yes, both roles.** Checked: `SOC_WIFI_FTM_SUPPORT 1` in `soc/esp32s3/.../soc_caps.h`.

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Initiator | Station interface only: `esp_wifi_ftm_initiate_session(&cfg)` with `resp_mac`, `channel`, `frm_count` (0/16/24/32/64), `burst_period`. Result arrives as `WIFI_EVENT_FTM_REPORT` (`dist_est` cm, `rtt_est`, `rtt_raw` ns, status). Checked in `esp_wifi.h`. |
| Responder | SoftAP only on ESP chips: `wifi_config.ap.ftm_responder = true` [1][3]. The initiator does **not** need to associate [3]: it only needs the AP's MAC and channel. |
| Both at once | Mode `WIFI_MODE_APSTA`: own SoftAP = responder, STA = initiator. The API docs explicitly cover "initiated on the channel the internal SoftAP is started in" (normal burst; another channel falls back to one ASAP burst). Checked. |
| Build switch | `CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_FTM_ENABLE` is **off by default** (initiator/responder sub-options default on once enabled). Checked in `esp_wifi/Kconfig`. **OS change needed** (sdkconfig.defaults, owned by idfport). |
| Calibration | Fixed offset is real and big. ESP-IDF example: read the distance at 0 m, set it with `esp_wifi_ftm_resp_set_offset(cm)` on the responder [1]. Reports for S3 responders: ~40-64 m offset at 0 m, and the offset **changed** between associated and not associated [4]; S2 pairs showed ~0 offset [4]. Espressif blamed calibration. So: measure on our badges, always in the same (unassociated) state, keep the constant in code. |
| Accuracy | S3 to S3 (SoftAP responder, unassociated, 20 MHz, 2.4 GHz): median error **~1.2 m indoors** in a hallway with one channel; worst case **~9-15 m** (multipath). Taking the **minimum RTT** over several channels cut the median to 30-70 cm and the worst case to ~2.5-10 m [3]. S2 study: ~1 m outdoors after offset, ~5 m indoors (75% < 5 m, 10% > 8 m), "far from usable in complex indoor environments" [5]. Expect ~1-2 m typical, occasional 5-10 m outliers in a crowded hall. |
| Burst size bug | S3 sessions with `frm_count` > 8 failed often (status FAIL) in IDF 4.4/5.x reports; `-c 8` worked reliably [4]. Closed without a fix. To test on v6.0.2; fall back to 8 or 16. |
| Time per measurement | 16-frame burst **~325 ms** on S3; a channel switch **~500 ms** [3]. S2: 636 ms per operation, 75.6 mA average during FTM [5]. So one peer per ~0.3-0.6 s, sequentially. |
| How many peers | One initiator session at a time (single `esp_wifi_ftm_end_session`, single report buffer). Round-robin: 8 peers ≈ 3-5 s per full sweep. A responder serving several initiators at once is undocumented: assume collisions, retry with jitter. |
| Alongside ESP-NOW | ESP-NOW runs in STA or AP mode on the current channel. With everything on one fixed channel (Pong uses 1) discovery and FTM share the radio; nothing found says they conflict, but FTM bursts will delay ESP-NOW packets for ~0.3 s. Needs a test. |
| Responder cost | The badge must run a SoftAP: it beacons every ~100 ms and phones see the SSID. Hidden SSID (`ssid_hidden=1`) should still answer FTM (the initiator addresses the MAC directly) - **unverified, test it**. SoftAP MAC = STA MAC + 1 on ESP32; announce it in the discovery packet anyway. |

## 2. RSSI as distance (ESP-NOW or BLE)

- Free: every ESP-NOW receive callback carries `info->rx_ctrl->rssi` (dBm). No OS change, unlimited peers.
- Model: `d = 10^((RSSI_1m - RSSI) / (10 n))`, `RSSI_1m` ~ -40..-50 dBm, n ~ 2 (open) to 2.7-4 (indoor) [6][7].
- How bad: reliable within ~4 m line of sight, < 25% error; beyond that, or behind people/walls, it overestimates
  badly; one wall = -6 dB at 1 m [6]. In one building RSSI at 1.5 m equalled RSSI beyond 10 m [5].
  A 6-8 dB swing (normal fading, a body in the way, the badge turned around) is a factor ~2 in distance.
  A badge worn on a chest has the wearer's body on one side: ~10-20 dB shadow behind them.
- Smoothing: per peer, take the **max** (or 80th percentile) RSSI over a 3-5 s window (the strongest packet is
  the least obstructed path, same idea as RTT-min), then an EMA. Show **buckets**, not metres:
  "here (< 2 m)", "near (2-6 m)", "around (> 6 m)", "fading" (not heard for 10 s).
- BLE: no better than ESP-NOW for RSSI, adds the BT stack and Wi-Fi/BT coexistence. Not worth it.

## 3. Direction

- **BLE direction finding (AoA/AoD, CTE): not on the S3.** Checked: `SOC_BLE_CTE_SUPPORTED` exists only for
  ESP32-C5, C61, H2, H21. It also needs an antenna array; the badge has one antenna.
- No IMU, no compass, one antenna: **the badge cannot measure a bearing by itself.**
- What is credible:
  1. **Body-shadow sweep** (fox-hunting trick): hold the badge against the chest and turn slowly; the peer is
     where RSSI peaks (your body blocks 10-20 dB behind you). The app can show live RSSI per peer and remember
     the peak. The badge cannot know which way you face, so the user marks it: turn the **AS5600 knob** as
     the bearing ("knob points where I face"), or press A at the peak. Works for one target at a time; slow.
  2. **Relative map from shared ranges**: each badge broadcasts its FTM distances to the others. With 3+
     badges in range, classical MDS/trilateration places everyone in 2D **up to rotation and mirror**. With
     1-2 m errors and peers a few metres apart, the shape is rough; it improves with more badges.
     Rotation/mirror can be fixed by one bearing from (1) or the knob. Nice demo, most code, most testing.
  3. **Walk and watch**: distance (FTM) going down while you walk = you are heading toward it. A trend arrow
     "warmer / colder" per peer is cheap and honest.
- Not credible: phase/ToF tricks with one antenna, Wi-Fi CSI direction (needs multiple antennas).

## 4. Discovery and identity

- Broadcast an ESP-NOW packet every ~1 s (+ random jitter) on a fixed channel (1, same as Pong):
  `magic "BRDR"`, version, OS version, SoftAP MAC, name (≤ 12 chars), and (option C) a short list of
  `(peer id, distance cm)`. ~250 bytes max per packet.
- Name: badge os has no name today and no keyboard. Options: a pronounceable handle derived from the MAC
  ("blue-otter-3F") with zero setup; or a name picked letter by letter with the buttons/knob and saved in NVS;
  or an OS-wide "badge name" setting (ask idfport). No personal data in the repo either way.
- Channel: all radar badges must share one channel. A badge joined to the conference Wi-Fi sits on the AP's
  channel, so the radar must not call `wifi_connect` (it does not need to).
- Power: Wi-Fi on with power save off (Pong does this; modem sleep drops packets) is ~100 mA receive; FTM
  ~75 mA average [5]. The radar is a "look now" app, not a background service: the home screen turns Wi-Fi off
  when it returns. Battery capacity is not in docs/DEVICE_INFO.md, so no run-time figure.
- Mode change is app-side: `wifi_on()` sets STA once; the app switches to `WIFI_MODE_APSTA` and must put STA
  back before returning. Only the FTM Kconfig switch needs the OS.

## 5. What the e-paper can show

- ~0.27 s per frame, ~3.5-4 frames/s at best, ghosts where ink was erased. So: no sweeping beam, no smooth motion.
- Good: fixed rings/grid drawn once; peer dots or names moved every 2-5 s; a list sorted by distance with big
  numbers ("3.2 m") and a small trend arrow; scale 3-4 text (24-32 px) for names. `ui_wipe` every few minutes
  or on scene change to clear ghosts. Redraw only when a bucket or rounded distance changes.

## 6. Design options

**A. Nearby list (RSSI only).** ESP-NOW discovery, list of badges sorted by smoothed RSSI with buckets
("here / near / around") and signal bars; optional "find" mode for one badge: big live bar plus
body-shadow sweep hint.
+ No OS change, works with 50+ badges, cheap, small code. − No metres, distance is a rough guess, no direction.

**B. Range radar (ESP-NOW discovery + FTM).** APSTA: own hidden SoftAP answers FTM; round-robin FTM to the
~8 strongest peers, RTT-min over a few bursts, fixed calibration offset. Screen: concentric rings at 2/5/10 m,
peers as labelled dots at their distance, spread around the circle by id (the angle is not a bearing, say so
on screen), plus a sorted list. Walk-toward trend arrows.
+ Real metres, ~1-2 m typical. − OS Kconfig change; S3 offset/bug risks need hardware tests first; ~3-5 s per
sweep with 8 peers; still no true direction.

**C. Map (B + shared ranges + manual bearing).** Badges broadcast their measured distances; with 3+ badges
the app solves a 2D layout (MDS) and draws everyone as a map; the knob (or one body-shadow sweep) rotates/
flips it into the real world.
+ The only "where", the best demo. − Most code; layout is shaky with 1-2 m errors; needs 3+ badges running
radar at once; depends on B working.

Recommendation: build **A first** (it is B's discovery layer anyway), run the FTM experiments below on two
badges, then grow into **B** if the numbers hold. C only if B looks good at the con.

## 7. Hardware experiments that settle it (for the humans, each > 15 s)

1. FTM offset and spread: two badges with a test build (FTM on, APSTA, hidden SSID), at 0, 1, 3, 5, 10 m,
   30 readings each, `frm_count` 8 and 16. Gives the offset, the noise, the burst-size bug on v6.0.2, and
   whether hidden SSID works.
2. Offset stability: same at 0 m after reboot and on a second pair of badges (is one constant enough?).
3. ESP-NOW while ranging: packet loss of 1 Hz beacons during continuous FTM.
4. Body shadow: badge on chest, other badge 5 m away, RSSI facing toward vs away.

## 8. Phase 2 spec: faster ranging that leaves v0.8 badges as they are (for idfport)

Constraint (owner): a badge on v0.8 must see exactly what it sees today and never get more FTM requests than today.
What v0.8 does (tag v0.8, `main/main.c`): its ESP-NOW callback drops anything that does not start with `BOSR` before
taking its lock (line 664); it rejects beacons with more than 8 ranges and ignores bytes after the 12-byte name; it
aims FTM at the `ap` address from our beacon on channel 1 (16 frames, burst period 2, 2 s wait, 50-150 ms pause);
its table holds 32 pairs and already overflows with 8-10 badges, so more `BOSR` traffic would evict its own entries
faster. Everything below changes updated badges only.

**Step 0, timing (two updated badges).** Log every FTM session: peer, ms from initiate to report, status, cm. Try
(frames 16, burst period 0), (8, 0), (16, 1) against today's (16, 2). Keep the fastest that keeps the success rate
and still reads about 0 cm side by side (`RNG_OFFSET_CM` 0 was checked with (16, 2)).

1. SoftAP `beacon_interval` 100 -> 1000 TU: the hidden AP's beacons do nothing for ranging (estimate: ~1.5 ms of
   air each at 1 Mbps, ~1.3% of the channel per badge). Check once that a v0.8 badge still ranges an updated badge.
2. FTM: the setting from step 0; report wait 2000 -> 500 ms; pause 50-150 -> 5-20 ms random.
3. New fast packet `BOSF`, every 250 +- 50 ms, also when empty: `magic[4], n, n x {mac[6], int16 cm}` = the raw
   results (after `RNG_OFFSET_CM`) of the sessions the sender completed since its previous `BOSF`, n <= 16.
   The ~1 s `BOSR` beacon stays byte for byte as today (v0.8 never sees `BOSF`: wrong magic).
   Receiving a `BOSF` from X (only once X's `BOSR` gave us its entry and `ap`): mark X as updated (time); each
   (b, cm) becomes shared entry X->b as in `BOSR`; if b is me, record cm on my own entry me->X exactly like my own
   measurement (into `hist`, min of last 4).
4. Who measures, in the round robin: skip a peer whose own entry got a result (mine or from its `BOSF`) in the
   last 400 ms. A peer not marked updated in the last 5 s is a v0.8 badge: at most one attempt per 5 s on it,
   whatever the result (v0.8 itself gets to each peer every ~5-10 s, so its load does not rise).
   Each pair of updated badges is then measured by whichever side gets there first and the other side reuses
   it: about half the FTM traffic, and at most ~2.5 measurements/s per pair when few badges are around.

Risk check: a v0.8 badge's FTM success rate on an updated badge while 2+ other updated badges range nearby,
before and after. If it falls, lengthen the pause in 2.
Expected: if a session takes ~50 ms, distances between updated badges refresh 1-2 times/s with 8-10 badges;
pairs with a v0.8 badge stay as today. Radar needs no change (it reads `ranging_get` every frame).
